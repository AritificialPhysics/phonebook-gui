# phonebook-gui
GUI version of the [phonebook app](https://github.com/AritificialPhysics/phonebook)

Works in the exact way as the above does, just uses a Graphical Interface. Actions are handled through buttons, and text input is handled through entry fields.
Utilizes the tkinter framework of Python.
